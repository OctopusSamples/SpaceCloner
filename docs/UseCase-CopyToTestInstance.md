# Copying to and from test instance

A lot of customers like to stand up a test instance to verify upgrades.  They want a set of projects that mimic the common deployment processes as their production instance.  

This use case is supported in with the Space Cloner script.

Please refer to the [how it works page](HowItWorks.md#what-will-it-clone) to get a full list of items cloned and not cloned.

# Example

In this use case, you probably want to copy everything, but only include a handful of projects.  In the example script below it will copy all everything in a space plus a set of specific projects.  It will only copy targets and workers related to the projects you wish to clone.

Please refer to the [Parameter reference page](ParameterReference.md) for more details on the parameters.

The other options are:
- `OverwriteExistingVariables` - set to `True` so variables are always overwritten (except for sensitive variables).
- `AddAdditionalVariableValuesOnExistingVariableSets` - set to `True` to add new variables values found for the same variable name.  
- `OverwriteExistingCustomStepTemplates` - Set to `True` so the step templates are kept in sync. You might have made some recent changes to the step template.  It is important to keep them up to date.
- `OverwriteExistingLifecyclesPhases` - Set to `True` since this is a full clone the overwrite existing lifecycle phases has been set to true as well.
- `CloneProjectChannelRules` - set to `true` as you'll want to include the channel rules with the project.
- `CloneTeamUserRoleScoping` - set to `true` as you'll want to include all the scoped permissions with the teams.
- `CloneProjectVersioningReleaseCreationSettings` - set to `true` as you'll want to include the release creation settings.
